Yugio Game Sudo Code

Prototype idea:
1 deck of 40 cards
shuffle deck (deque swap)
card classes (Spell Card, Trap Card, Monster Card)
Life Points (8000 LP)
Coin Toss(Heads, Tails)
Dice Roll(1-6)
Game Mat/Field/Play Zones (Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Graveyard, Deck Zone)
Card Positions (Attack, Defense, Set) (states 1,2,3)

Card Types:
Monster
		Name, Attribute, Level, ATK, DEF, Type, Effect
Spell/Trap
		Name, Type, Effect, Icon
		
Sudo Code:

Create Cards:
	Card Class
		int index = 0;
		string name = null;
		string description = null;
		string effect = null;
		enum effectPhase = null;
	Monster Class
		enum attribute = null;
		int level = 0;
		int attack = 0;
		int defense = 0;
		
	Spell/Trap Class
		enum type = null;
		enum icon = Normal;
	
Create Decks:
	Decks will be of type deque and to be used have to be betwee 40-60 cards
	Building decks will be adding index to end of deque
	if deque size is less than 60
	masterdeck.pushback(Card Index);
	
Shuffle Deck:
	create copy of master deck so that we can edit/shuffle/remove cards when necessary
	randomely shuffle each card with another card until deck is randomized
	
Pre Game Setup:
	Shuffle Decks
	Flip Coin
	Winner Chooses 1st or 2nd
	Draw 5 cards for each person (hand is of type deque, pushback first 5 cards of the deck, popfront first 5 cards of the deck)

Game:
	While Loop until end condition is met: Players will take turns until one player's Life Points is zero or until a player can no longer draw a card
	while(Player 1 LP > 0 && Player 2 LP > 0 && Player 1 next card != null && Player 2 next card != null)
	{
		while player 1 turn do turn
		while player 2 turn do turn
	}
	
Each Turn
	Draw Phase: Draw 1 card(push hand, pop deck) and other possible actions (Spell/Trap cards)
	Main Phase: 
			Summon/Set any 1 monster (pop hand, push monster zone or spell/trap zone as appropriate, set state to face down, face up attack, or face up defense)
			Summon/Set any Spell/Trap (pop hand, push monster zone or spell/trap zone as appropriate, set state to face down, face up attack, or face up defense)
			Change Battle Position - if monster card has not changed this turn and has not been played this turn then set state to attack or defense
			Activate card or effect
	Battle Phase (while the player wants to attack)
		If this is not the first turn continue
		Select monster to attack with, select monster to attack
		Allow player being attacked to activate counter trap cards
		If attacked card is face down flip face up defense position
		resolve any flip effect
		if targeted monster changes in any way go back to step 2
		if targeted monster is in attack position then find the difference between attack 1 and attack 2. 
			if difference is positive then destroy targeted monster and send to graveyard(erase opponent monster zone, push opponent graveyard) and subtract difference from opponent's LP
			if no difference then destry both monsters and send to graveyard(erase both monster zones, push both graveyards)
			if difference is negative then destroy attacking monster and send to graveyard(erase monster zone, push graveyard) and subtract the absolute difference from LP
		if targeted monster is in defense position then find the difference between attack 1 and defense 2
			if difference is positive then destroy attacked monster and send to graveyard(erase opponent monster zone, push opponent graveyard)
			if no difference then destry both monsters and send to graveyard(erase both monster zones, push both graveyards)
			if difference is negative then destroy attacking monster and send to graveyard(erase monster zone, push graveyard) and subtract the difference from LP
		Go back to step 2 and repeat until player is done attacking
	Main Phase 2:
		if player did not already summon or set a monster then they can do so
		if a monsters' position has not been changed yet and the monster did not attack in battle phase then the player can change it 
		can activate a cards or effects
		can set spell or trap cards
	End Phase:
		While the player has more than 6 cards in their hand then select as many cards as needed and discard them to the graveyard
		Resolve any card effects which activate in this phase
		can activate any trap cards or quick play spell cards
	set turn to other player
